# Crowdfunding ETL

## Overview of Project 
Independent Funding is a company who specializes in crowdfunding for independent projects. Its platform has grown. There is now a need to convert the one Excel file of data into a PostgreSQL database. The purpose for this shift is allow the analytics team to perform analysis and create reports. I helped Britta, a junior SQL developer, with the following tasks: 
s
1. Extract and transfrom the Excel file into four CSV files 
2. Create a PostgreSQL database and tables by using an ERD 
3. Load the CSV files into the database 
4. Perform the SQL queries to generate reports for stakeholders 

After executing these tasks, the company received a new database that contains backers information. With this new database, Britta and I performed an ETL process and a data analysis with the help of SQL queries.
